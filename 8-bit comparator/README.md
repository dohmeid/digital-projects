8-bit Comparator for signed 2’s complement representation numbers
********************************************************************
This project illustrates the design and the functional verification of an 8-bit Comparator for signed 2’s complement representation numbers.
The implementation of the circuit was done using two different stages. 
Stage one uses Ripple Adder/subtractor or Look-ahead Adder/subtractor for the design while stage two uses a magnitude (unsigned) comparator.
